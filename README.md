# Simple Shooter
Play a fun yet simple space shooter ! ðŸ˜¼

Use W A S D or arrow keys to move
Use **Shift** to Dash

Shoot Power Ups to Upgrade your ship and projectile speed !

Try to get the highest score !

But remember, you only have **3** lives

### Important Note: 
* GreenFoot Sound only allows one sound to play at a time, so I had to chop off the majority of the audio file to fit it.
* The Binary Search Tree for high score implementation is not memory or speed efficient for only displaying 5 scores, but it was interesting to implement. If you wanted to keep all the scores while ranking the highest ones, a binary search tree is efficient -> (o(log(n)) query and o(log(n)) update (But depends how balanced the tree is). Implementing an arraylist and sorting everytime would have O(n) update and and O(n(log(n)) query.
